## 2. Software setup

### 2.1 General configuration

1. Download the Project from the [Releases on Github]( https://github.com/NimmLor/esp8266-fastled-iot-webserver/releases ) and extract the archive

2. Open the **.ino** file inside the folder in the Arduino IDE

3. Create the **Secrets.h** file, if the repository was cloned
   *Top Right Corner >> New Tab >> "Secrets.h"*

   ![](software_screenshots/newtab.png?raw=true)

4. Paste the following code and fill in your WiFi credentials, if you need MQTT fill in the credentials too

   ```c++
   // AP mode password
   const char WiFiAPPSK[] = "your-password";
   
   // Wi-Fi network to connect to (if not in AP mode)
   char* ssid = "your-ssid";
   char* password = "your-password";
   
   // only required when MQTT is enabled
   const char* mqttUser = "YourMqttUser";
   const char* mqttPassword = "YourMqttUserPassword";
   ```

   ![](software_screenshots/secret.png?raw=true)

5. Configure the main parameters
   In the esp8266-fastled-iot-webserver.ino file there are many parameters to change and tweak the essential settings are:
- `LED_TYPE`: The type of LED strip that is used (WS2812B, APA102, ...)
- `DATA_PIN`: The pin where the LED-Strip is connected
- `CLK_PIN`:  Additional clock pin when using LED-Strips with 4 pins.
  *Note: If you are using another controller such as a clone or a NodeMCU board, you may need to configure the pin assignment for FastLED, See also [this entry in the FastLED Wiki](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/ESP8266-notes))*
- `CORRECTION`: Affects color calibration, if colors appear weird, you might want to use `TypicalLEDStrip`
- `COLOR_ORDER`:  Ordering of the colors sent, **depends on the LED-Strip**, if colors are swapped, then swap the Letters (RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BRG, BGR)
- `MILLI_AMPS`: How much current your power supply can handle in mA
- `VOLTS`: How much voltage your power supply delivers in Volts
- `HOSTNAME`: Name of the Device, **don't use whitespaces, use "-" instead when enabling mDNS**
- **Important**: `DEVICE_TYPE` defines what device you are using, see the list below the code and choose the number

- Click on *Tools >> Serial Monitor*
- When pressing the *Reset-Button* on the esp8266, the console should print the IP-Address

5. Connect to the UI by opening http://ip_address/ in your browser of choice, this works on mobile devices too. If mDNS was enabled, you should be able to access the UI via http://<Hostname>.local/



## 4. Alexa configuration

The connect your esp8266, the "Pairing-Mode" mode must be activated to add it to your Smart-Home devices in the alexa app.

Open http://ip_of_the_esp8266/alexa in your browser, the window should tell you that it is ready to be discovered by your alexa device.

**Important**: The esp8266 and you Amazon Echo device **must** be in the same network.

Just say to your echo, "Alexa, discover devices". This phrase can be spoken out in English on any echo device independent of the device's language.

After around 30 seconds, Alexa should respond with the devices that were found. These should show up in the Alexa app.
